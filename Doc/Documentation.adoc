== Introduction

== README
* get the code at https://github.com/florisz/BerghAdmin/settings/access
* SQL Server
** install a SQL server on your local (or antoher accessible) machine
** create a database with name 'BIHZ2021' with a user/password with read/write permissions 
(can actually be any name but this one is most convenient)
** install latest entity framework client tools; see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet +
just calling 'dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef' will do the job
* Secrets
** get secrets file from another developer (is not in the repo)
** store secrets file in solution directory (keep calm, git will not synchronize it to other repos)
** load secrets into your private secret store with ./SetSecrets.ps1
** change the "DatabaseConfiguration:ConnectionString" with your own specific value 
(use the values you've chosen above and one of the commands below)
** run 'dotnet ef database update' from the command line (this should create an empty database)
* Source code
** start Visual studio and load the solution file
** Open the 'Test Explorer' window and run all unit tests (this should give you a safe feeling)
** debug/run the default project (should be BerghAdmin)

== Domain overview

=== Business background

BerghAdmin will be used by the backoffice people of the charity
organization Bergh in het Zadel (BIHZ). With the aid of many donors BIHZ
collects money to fight cancer or as the slogan says: "to buy time for cancer
patients".

BIHZ is currently active in: 

* maintaining a group of Ambassadors which donate every year
* organizing a cycle tour every four year to raise money
* organizing multiple golfevents every year also to raise money

Next to this money is raised to ad-hoc events and people and organizations donate money
occasionaly.

To accomodate this (automated) support is needed for all administrative roles. In the 
next paragraph the most common tasks are mentioned.
The BerghAdmin application is meant to deliver this support to all volunteers in 
administrative roles. Focused at freeing up their time for other more fun stuff, achieving
one central consistent administration and conform to legislation (financially and AVG proof).

=== Context
Functionally the domain for BerghAdmin is:

[[UseCaseModel, Use case model]]
.Context diagram BerghAdmin 
image::UseCaseModel.png[]

For each of the four subdomains (Ambassadeurs, Fietstochten, Golfdagen and Fiancien) specific
support is needed to manage the subdomain. However there is generic support in: 
creating/sending emails, creating/sending invoices and the (central) administration of
all people connected to the BIHZ-organization.

For the handling (administration, payment and invoicing) of mainly small gifts BIHZ relies on the
Kentaa service offering. With Kentaa, donors can define their own donate page thru which 
money is raised for BIHZ. On regular intervals (a Timer) the BerghAdmin system will read
the Kenta information and link it to the appropriate persons in the administration. This will
enable a smooth financial management of all incoming gifts.

=== Structure
The high level class model for the application:

[[BerghAdminClassModel, BerghAdmin class model]]

image::BerghAdminClassModel.png[]

Kentaa is a separate organization which is handling gifts and
collecting money from a large group of donateurs. Mainly for the money
earned by cyclists but also other 'projects' are handled with the aid
of this service. Kentaa stores its information in the following structure:

[[KentaaDataModel, Kentaa data model]]
.Data model Kentaa 
image::KentaaDataModel.png[]

=== Scenario's

[sidebar]
Look at the Integration test 'FullKentaaIntegrationTest' in the BerghAdmin.Tests project for an 
overview of the described mechanism and dependencies.

Design of the scenario how to read in the Kenta information. As can be seen from the class
model Kentaa stores its information in 5 seperate entities (classes).  The Site class in
Kentaa corresponds to BIHZ and is therefore irrelevant to BerghAdmin. The following table
shows the correspondence between the Kentaa and the BerghAdmin classes:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Kentaa class | Bihz class | Data is linked to

| User | BihzUser | Persoon, based on email address stored in BihzUser
| Project | BihzProject | Evenement, based on title stored in BihzProject
| Action | BihzAction | Persoon, based on email address stored in BihzAction
| Donation | BihzDonatie | Step 1: link to Persoon via the ActionId in the BihzDonatie +
Step2: add/update the Donatie via the BihzDonatie.Id
|===


The Kentaa class is regularly retrieved from the Kentaa API by an Azure funtion and mapped to the
Bihz class. The content of the Bihz class is sent to one of the 4 corresponding endpoints of the  
BerghAdmin web application. When received the incoming is processed as described in the table
above.

This illustrated with:

[[KentaaReadApiSequence, Kentaa Api usage]]
.Kentaa Api read sequence 
image::KentaaInleesSequence.png[]

To handle all incoming data in the BerghAdmin Api, four endpoints have been created. one
for each of the data types received from the Kentaa function. The following paragraphs will
show this

==== Projects
Any incoming project must be mapped to an evenement. It is required the title of the
incoming project must match the (unique) title of the evenement.
This is shown in:

[[KentaaVerwerkProjectSequence, Handle incoming Kentaa projects]]
.Handle incoming Kentaa Projects sequence 
image::KentaaVerwerkProjectSequence.png[]

==== Acties
An actie in Kentaa corresponds to the webpage of a user. With this page the user is collecting
money for Bergh in het Zadel. 
Any incoming actie must therefore be mapped to a persoon. It is required the email address of the
incoming actie must match the (unique primary) email address of the persoon.
This is shown in:

[[KentaaVerwerkActieSequence, Handle incoming Kentaa acties]]
.Handle incoming Kentaa Acties sequence 
image::KentaaVerwerkActieSequence.png[]

==== Users
Incoming users are treated pretty similar as Acites (see previous paragraph). This is because
each user is linked to a Persoon also. 
Any incoming user must be mapped to a persoon. It is required the email address of the
incoming user must match the (unique primary) email address of the persoon.
This is shown in:

[[KentaaVerwerkUserSequence, Handle incoming Kentaa users]]
.Handle incoming Kentaa Users sequence 
image::KentaaVerwerkUserSequence.png[]

==== Donaties
Incoming donaties are treated slightly different than the previous three types. This is
mainly because donaties in Kentaa are linked to acties while each donatie in the BIHZ domain must
be linked to a persoon.
This results in the following design:
